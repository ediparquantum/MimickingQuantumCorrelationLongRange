## Abstract

The quantum long-range extended Ising model possesses several striking features which cannot be observed in the corresponding short-range model. We report that the pattern obtained from the entanglement between any two arbitrary sites of the long-range model can be mimicked by the model having a finite range of interactions provided the interaction strength is moderate. On the other hand, we illustrate that when the interactions are strong, the entanglement distribution in the long-range model does not match the class of a model with a few interactions. We also show that the monogamy score of entanglement is in good agreement with the behavior of pairwise entanglement. Specifically, it saturates when the entanglement in the finite-range Hamiltonian behaves similarly to the long-range model, while it decays algebraically otherwise.

## Code
Code relies on the [Quantum Information and Computation library (QIClib)](https://titaschanda.github.io/QIClib/). 

### QIClib

The QIClib library has the following benefits.

+ Mordern C++11 library suited for general purpose quantum computing. 
+ It supports cross platform usage (Linux, Windows and Mac OS X). 
+ It is a header only template library.
+ It uses Armadillo (developed by Conrad Sanderson et al., Data61, Australia) for highly efficient linear algebra calculations, and if available, the NLopt nonlinear optimization library for certain features.
